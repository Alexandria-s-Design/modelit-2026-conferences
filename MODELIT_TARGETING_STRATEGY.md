## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Proposal Rejections
**Mitigation**: Submit to 15+ conferences, expect 40-50% acceptance rate

### Risk: Low Booth Traffic
**Mitigation**: Pre-schedule appointments, offer giveaways, active aisle engagement

### Risk: Technical Difficulties
**Mitigation**: Offline demo mode, backup devices, printed screenshots

### Risk: Competitor Presence
**Mitigation**: Differentiation messaging, unique value props, relationship focus

### Risk: Budget Overruns
**Mitigation**: Tiered participation model, shared booth options, virtual alternatives

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors at Conferences
- **Cell Collective (original)**: University-level platform, not K-12 focused
- **PhET Interactive Simulations**: Free, popular, but not systems biology
- **HHMI BioInteractive**: High-quality content, not interactive modeling
- **Concord Consortium**: STEM simulations, different pedagogical approach

### ModelIt Differentiators
1. **Free for Teachers**: No cost barrier to adoption
2. **K-12 Optimized**: Age-appropriate interface and content
3. **NGSS Aligned**: Explicit standards alignment documentation
4. **Research-Based**: Built on published Cell Collective platform
5. **Full Curriculum**: Complete lesson libraries, not just simulations
6. **PD Support**: Professional development and implementation support
