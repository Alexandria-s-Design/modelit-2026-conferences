## Using the Templates

### For Science Teacher Conferences (NSTA, NABT)
**Template**: `proposal-templates/NSTA-NABT-Workshop-Template.md`

**Customize these sections**:
- [ ] Session title (keep under 10 words)
- [ ] 50-word description (hook them fast)
- [ ] 250-word full description (include NGSS alignment)
- [ ] Learning objectives (3-5 specific outcomes)
- [ ] Your presenter bio (100 words)
- [ ] Headshot photo (high-resolution)
- [ ] 2-minute demo video link

**Keep as-is**:
- Session outline structure (proven format)
- NGSS alignment section (already comprehensive)
- Materials checklist (comprehensive)
- Technology requirements (standard)

### For Research Conferences (AERA, ICLS, ISDC)
**Template**: `proposal-templates/Research-Conference-Template.md`

**Customize these sections**:
- [ ] Abstract (350 words - use real data from pilot study)
- [ ] Methods section (update with actual sample size)
- [ ] Results section (include preliminary findings)
- [ ] Co-author information (add research partners)

**Optional**:
- Full paper (only if conference requires it upfront)
- Data availability (if publishing actual research)

### For EdTech Showcases (ISTE, FETC, CoSN)
**Template**: `proposal-templates/EdTech-Showcase-Template.md`

**Customize these sections**:
- [ ] Elevator pitch (practice this out loud)
- [ ] Demo flow (time yourself - must fit in 15 min)
- [ ] Evidence of impact (update with latest pilot data)
- [ ] Testimonials (add real teacher quotes)

## Conference Selection Decision Tree

```
Is it a biology/science teacher conference?
├─ YES → Tier 1 (MUST attend) → NSTA, NABT
└─ NO → Is it STEM/EdTech focused?
    ├─ YES → Tier 2 (Strategic) → ISTE, SIGCSE, CSTA
    └─ NO → Is it systems thinking/research?
        ├─ YES → Tier 1 or 2 → ISDC, ICLS, AERA
        └─ NO → Tier 3 or skip → Lower priority
```

## Key Contacts to Save

| Organization | Contact | Purpose |

## Proposal Submission Checklist

Before hitting "Submit" on any conference proposal:
- [ ] Spell-checked and proofread
- [ ] All required sections completed
- [ ] Word/character limits respected
- [ ] NGSS alignment documented (if science conference)
- [ ] Presenter bio and headshot attached
- [ ] Demo video recorded and uploaded (if requested)
- [ ] Co-presenter information confirmed (if applicable)
- [ ] Technology requirements clearly stated
- [ ] Accessibility considerations addressed
- [ ] Supporting materials prepared (sample lessons, etc.)
- [ ] Confirmation email received after submission

## What Success Looks Like

### If Proposal Accepted
1. Immediately confirm acceptance (most have deadlines)
2. Register for conference (early bird rates)
3. Book travel and hotel ASAP (major conferences sell out)
4. Add to calendar and notify team
5. Begin preparing materials (slides, handouts, booth)

### If Proposal Rejected
1. Don't take it personally (40-60% rejection is normal)
2. Request reviewer feedback (some conferences provide)
3. Pivot to attend-only or booth exhibition
4. Apply lessons learned to next proposal
5. Consider resubmitting to regional version

## Quick Tips from Charles

**DO**:
- Submit early (many conferences review on rolling basis)
- Be specific about learning outcomes
- Include real teacher testimonials
- Show NGSS alignment explicitly
- Offer hands-on activities, not just lecture
- Provide take-home materials

**DON'T**:
- Use jargon or academic language excessively
- Make it all about the product (focus on teacher needs)
- Forget to proofread
- Miss the deadline (set reminders 2 weeks early)
- Undersell the free access (huge differentiator)
