# Conference Proposal Template: NSTA/NABT Hands-On Workshop

## Session Information

**Title**: Making Systems Thinking Tangible: Interactive Cell Models for K-12 Classrooms

**Session Type**: Hands-On Workshop (90 minutes)

**Track**: Life Sciences / Technology Integration / NGSS Standards

**Target Audience**:
- Middle School Science Teachers (Grades 6-8)
- High School Biology Teachers (Grades 9-12)
- Science Department Coordinators
- STEM Integration Specialists

**Maximum Participants**: 40

## Short Description (50 words)
Discover how to engage students in authentic systems biology using free, interactive modeling tools. Teachers will build cell signaling models, run simulations, and analyze emergent behaviors—bringing AP-level biology concepts to life for all learners. Leave with ready-to-use NGSS-aligned lessons and free platform access.

## Full Description (250 words)

The Next Generation Science Standards emphasize systems thinking and modeling as core scientific practices, yet many teachers struggle to find accessible tools that make these abstract concepts concrete for K-12 learners. This hands-on workshop introduces ModelIt's Cell Collective platform—a free, research-based tool that transforms how students explore complex biological systems.

Participants will experience a guided modeling session where they construct an authentic cell signaling pathway, manipulate system variables, and observe emergent network behaviors. Through this active learning approach, teachers will discover how interactive modeling makes advanced concepts like feedback loops, signal amplification, and homeostasis accessible to middle and high school students.

The workshop demonstrates how these modeling experiences align with NGSS Performance Expectations across life sciences (MS-LS1, HS-LS1) and integrate computational thinking without requiring coding skills. Teachers will explore pre-built lesson plans covering gene regulation, immune response, cell cycle control, and metabolic pathways—all mapped to state and national standards.

By the end of this session, participants will:
- Build and simulate a functional biological network model
- Analyze how system components interact to produce emergent behaviors
- Evaluate age-appropriate entry points for different grade levels
- Access a library of 20+ ready-to-use classroom activities
- Create a free teacher account with full platform access
- Join a community of educators implementing systems biology education

No prior modeling experience required. Participants should bring a laptop or tablet with internet access. All materials provided are free for educational use.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. **Create** interactive models of biological systems using ModelIt's Cell Collective platform
2. **Explain** how systems modeling supports NGSS Science and Engineering Practices, specifically:
   - SEP2: Developing and Using Models
   - SEP5: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
   - SEP6: Constructing Explanations
3. **Identify** appropriate modeling activities for different grade levels (6-12)
4. **Implement** at least two ready-to-use lesson plans in their classroom within the next semester
5. **Analyze** student learning outcomes through model-based assessment strategies
