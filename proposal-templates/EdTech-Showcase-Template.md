# Conference Proposal Template: EdTech Showcase (ISTE, FETC, CoSN)

## Product Showcase Information

**Product Name**: ModelIt K-12 Systems Biology Platform

**Category**: Science Education Technology / STEM Tools / Learning Simulations

**Target Market**: K-12 Schools (Grades 6-12), Focus on Biology and Life Sciences

**Presentation Format**: 15-minute demo + 5-minute Q&A (or exhibition booth)

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

ModelIt makes advanced systems biology accessible to every K-12 student through free, interactive modeling tools. Teachers and students build, simulate, and analyze biological networks—bringing cell signaling, gene regulation, and metabolic pathways to life. NGSS-aligned, research-based, and designed for classrooms, not labs.

## Problem Statement (100 words)

Biology teachers face a critical challenge: NGSS standards require students to develop systems thinking and modeling skills, yet most available tools are either too simplistic (static diagrams), too expensive (specialized software), or too complex (university-level platforms).

Traditional biology instruction presents cells and systems as static, memorization-heavy topics. Students struggle to understand dynamic processes like signal transduction, feedback regulation, and emergent network behaviors. Teachers lack accessible tools to make these abstract concepts tangible.

The gap between what standards demand and what classrooms can deliver leaves students unprepared for modern biology, which is fundamentally about complex, interacting systems.

## Solution Overview (150 words)

ModelIt transforms biology education through an interactive, browser-based platform where students construct and simulate authentic biological systems. Built on the peer-reviewed Cell Collective platform, ModelIt offers:

**Free Access**: No cost for teachers or students, removing financial barriers

**Intuitive Interface**: Drag-and-drop modeling designed for middle and high schoolers, not research scientists

**Curriculum Integration**: 20+ ready-to-use lessons aligned to NGSS Performance Expectations (MS-LS1, HS-LS1)

**Authentic Science**: Real biological networks from published research, simplified for K-12

**Systems Thinking**: Students predict, test, and analyze emergent behaviors—not just memorize pathways

**No Coding Required**: Develops computational thinking without programming barriers

**Differentiation**: Scaffolded complexity for diverse learners, from basic models to advanced research

**Assessment Tools**: Model-based evaluation rubrics aligned to NGSS Science Practices

**Professional Development**: Teacher support through tutorials, webinars, and community forums
