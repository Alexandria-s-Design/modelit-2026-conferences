## Abstract (350 words)

**Background and Significance**

Systems thinking is recognized as a critical competency in science education, particularly for understanding complex biological phenomena. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize modeling and systems analysis as core scientific practices. However, K-12 teachers often lack accessible tools to engage students in authentic systems biology modeling. This study examines the impact of ModelIt's Cell Collective platform—a free, browser-based systems biology tool—on student conceptual understanding and systems thinking skills.

**Theoretical Framework**

This research draws on constructivist learning theory and model-based reasoning frameworks (Louca & Zacharia, 2012; Schwarz et al., 2009). We hypothesize that interactive modeling experiences support deeper understanding of emergent properties, feedback mechanisms, and network-level behaviors compared to traditional instruction methods.

**Research Questions**

1. How does engagement with interactive biological network models affect student understanding of systems-level concepts?
2. What systems thinking competencies develop through model construction and simulation activities?
3. How do learning outcomes vary across grade levels (middle vs. high school)?
4. What implementation factors predict successful integration of modeling tools?

**Methods**

Mixed-methods study conducted across 24 classrooms (N=847 students, grades 6-12) in diverse school settings. Intervention group (n=12 classrooms) used ModelIt platform for 6-week unit on cell signaling and gene regulation. Control group (n=12 classrooms) received traditional instruction on same content.

**Data Collection**:
- Pre/post conceptual assessments (Systems Thinking Hierarchical model)
- Student-created models and simulation experiments
- Teacher implementation logs and surveys
- Student interviews (n=48) on learning experiences
- Classroom observation protocols

**Data Analysis**:
- Quantitative: ANCOVA controlling for prior knowledge, t-tests for systems thinking gains
- Qualitative: Thematic analysis of student models and interview transcripts
- Mixed: Integration of quantitative gains with qualitative explanations

**Results**

Preliminary findings indicate:
- Intervention students showed significantly greater gains in systems thinking (d = 0.68, p < .001)
- Conceptual understanding of feedback loops improved 2.3x compared to control
- High school students demonstrated more sophisticated model construction
- Implementation fidelity varied; professional development predicted outcomes
- Students reported higher engagement and self-efficacy in modeling group

**Implications**

Results suggest interactive modeling tools can effectively develop systems thinking competencies when integrated with structured inquiry activities. Findings inform curriculum design, professional development needs, and EdTech integration strategies for NGSS implementation.
